Discover Advanced Pack 5]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Allow the purchase of combinations of products with or without a discount, in one click Would you like to increase your average shopping cart and at the same time, allow your customers to save money if they purchase several products simultaneously?It is now possible thanks to Advanced Pack ! Without waiting any longer, you can create packs of products that can be purchased in one click, without worrying about stock or their combinations. A precious additional sales tool Accompany your customers in their buying process, by offering them packs of coherent products that you will have predefined, just as the salesman in a real shop would do.Such as for example: this fantastic camera, memory card and tripod. You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers. Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them. Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities. Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?That is also possible! You will therefore be able to offer a free product if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite! Integrated assistant It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again Advanced Pack has the solution to the problem.When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock. There is also an integrated dynamic price simulator for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation. Remain the maestro of combinations One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?Advanced Pack will allow you to do this. You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog. Your customers will then be able to personalise their selection amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer. Business Incentive Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or spend more money per transaction.Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!Stop looking, you have already found the solution ! To entice your customers, Advanced Pack will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack. 3 possibilities are available: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on the set of productsApply a fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example Advanced Pack will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.This decision will be made even easier thanks to our clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily. You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs! Once again Advanced Pack has the solution. By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene. In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied. Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute respect for the legislation. Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated! For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will automatically be displayed as unavailable for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern. For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock ! Highlight your packs and sell more Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc... For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, Advanced Pack will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and able to finalise their purchase in one click. And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be highlighted on their data sheets for those being sold in lotsThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is cross-selling: an accessible method of increasing your average shopping cart ! We don't forget designers From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization. A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the Advanced Pack 5 engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.15]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[279.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[327.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[243.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1048]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookpsshoptab]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Advanced Shop for Fan Page]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Products on Facebook & Social Networks]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Create a multilingual, multicurrency and completely customized Facebook shop.

It allows you to display your products in sale on your site directly on the most popular social network. Then, you make the most of your Facebook community to boost the traffic on your PrestaShop site. Contrary to the native shop tab, that has many constraints, the "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module allows you to: create a completely customized Facebook shop, whether in terms of design, menu type or displaycreate a multilingual and multicurrency shopnot need to submit your products to Facebook for review in order to make them visible for the publicmake the PrestaShop website's modifications instantly visible on the Facebook shop (changes of price, product image,...)display featured categories on the home pagedisplay on Facebook the average rating of each product/category, given on your site (with the shape of stars) if you also have installed on your Prestashop our product rating "Customer Ratings and Reviews Pro + Google Rich Snippets" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/seo-natural-search-engine-optimization/6144-customer-ratings-and-reviews-pro-google-rich-snippets.html)  Notes: (x) 1/ So that real-time harmonization between Facebook and your online store is possible, the module has to create a new custom "shop" tab, independent of the default "shop" tab already installed by Facebook on your page. 2/ if you want to create Facebook catalogs and tag your products on Facebook and Instagram, you should choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module instead, that is available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html. 3/ Facebook mobile app does not allow custom tabs insertion, like the one created by our module. Therefore, this latter can only be displayed on the Facebook web version. If you want to see your Facebook shop on mobile, you have to choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html) in order to import your products into the native Facebook shop tab (however you will not be able to customize the shop).  To know more about the difference between the Facebook native shop tab (and filled by our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module) and the custom tab set by our "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module, read our detailed comparison at this address: https://faq.businesstech.fr/en/faq/230  ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.7]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[111.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[134.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[97.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/963149-pprod/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/963149-pbig/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google-Shopping)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,…) and Google partner sites!]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/price-comparison/1768-google-merchant-center-google-shopping.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/1768.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,…) and Google partner sites!]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Showcase your products on&nbsp;all the channels of Google Ads Shopping campaigns&nbsp;and develop your visibility without further delay.

In addition, you can choose the character to be displayed between the values of the same feature. If you also use our "Advanced Search 4" filters module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search-filters/2778-advanced-search-4-filters-search.html), you further increase the search relevance in your catalog. Our module is also compatible with the PrestaShop faceted search (block layered) native module.  Import your features and their multiple values in bulk action! Use the PrestaShop native CSV import tool to assign in bulk, and in a specific order, feature values to your products. In your "Products" CSV import file, use the "Feature(Name:Value:Position)" column to define for each feature the values to be assigned to each product. Indicate in the module configuration the character used to separate the different values and that's it! Example: Separator used: |Material:Yellow gold|White gold,Type of gemstone:Diamond This product will therefore be assigned 2 values of the feature "Material", and a single value of the feature "Type of gemstone".]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[search_filter]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.5.6]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[84.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1367793-pprod/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1367793-pbig/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[6841]]></id><name><![CDATA[thecheckout]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[One page checkout for Prestashop]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Express Checkout Process]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Intuitive.

There are now more than 4 billion active users in the world.So do not hesitate any more and use this incredible craze to your advantage! Allow your visitors to create a customer account instantly on your store, using their favorite social network, to which they are permanently connected. No more account creation or identification forms, which are real obstacles to conversion. Thanks to our "Social Login" module, Internet users, whether they already have an account on your shop or not, connect in only one click via Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon, PayPal or LinkedIn.No need to remember their password anymore! Even when changing device: whether they are on their smartphone or their tablet, a simple click on the social login button is enough to connect to their account on your store. Moreover, if they use a PayPal connection, their shipping/billing address is also automatically filled in their account. But that's not all! You can go even further in simplifying the shopping tunnel by linking "Social Login" with Presta-Module's "One Click Order" module and offering your customers, not only the one-click connection, but also the one-click order! Placing an order on your site has never been so easy!Find out "One Click Order" here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/payment-card-wallet/29273-one-click-order-buy-in-one-click.html (only for PrestaShop 1.7.x) TOTAL FREEDOM IN POSITIONING YOUR CONNECTORS The module offers you multiple possibilities to position your connectors and even goes so far as to leave you the hand to precisely place your connection buttons.In fact, in addition to the standard positions such as, among others, the login page or the order tunnel, the module provides you with two tools for an advanced position of your connectors: - HTML elements use: select the HTML element on which you want to see the buttons, fill it in the configuration and the module takes care of everything!- "Shortcode" use: for pro, simply fill out a configuration form and get the shortcode to insert directly into your theme template. A NEAT DESIGN AND ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION OF THE CONNECTION BLOCKS Our "Social Login" module, totally responsive, has been implemented according to the latest standards provided by social networks. The ergonomics of the buttons has been worked on to allow the best user experience, whatever the type of device used (smartphone, tablet, desktop computer, ...). In addition, regardless of the position chosen for your login buttons, the module provides you with a complete CSS tool allowing you to fully customize the appearance of each connection block, in a completely independent way. Take advantage of this customization flexibility to make your shop visually unique! New: In order to best adapt to the design of your site, the module also allows you to choose, for each position of the connectors, between standard or mini size buttons. Also, you can add a shaded effect under the buttons and round the edges for a perfect finish! A CONFIGURATION ADAPTED TO ALL The module is suitable for all skill levels! Benefit from a clear, intuitive and documented configuration interface that allows you to set up your login buttons as quickly and efficiently as possible. Choose the default positions defined by the module for an ultra-fast installation. You have some technical skills? Use the advanced positioning tool of the module! Finally, for the pros, the shortcode generator will allow you the greatest freedom of integration.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[4.0.3]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[97.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[119.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[84.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1468224-pprod/social-login-facebook-google-paypal-amazon-twitter.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1468224-pbig/social-login-facebook-google-paypal-amazon-twitter.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8296]]></id><name><![CDATA[idxcookies]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[GDPR Cookies Law (Advice - Audit - Blocking)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Legal]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Complies with the European Cookies Law (included in GDPR).

The user can configure the type of cookies to which he or she wants to give consent by clicking on the ‘Manage Cookies’ button and selecting which cookies he or she wants to activate or not.Blocking CookiesThe module allows the blocking of cookies until the user gives his consent. Cookies can be functional (mandatory) or from third parties. They allow the user to give his or her consent separately.

The module includes a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code …). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its opacity percentage (transparency) and its position (above or below the screen). In addition, the module is multi-language and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to write a different message per language.Information: we have developed the module so that it does not appear when search engine robots crawl your website and that it does not affect your SEO. Block screen until cookies are acceptedTo help the online shop lose as little information as possible it has an option that does not allow the customer to browse until they accept the cookie policy, i.e. it blocks the screen until the user accepts the cookies. Notice in the form of a pop upThe module displays a pop up to inform your customers about the use of cookies and ask for their consent for their installation. Multi-store modeThe module is compatible with multi-store mode and allows you to put the same warning banner in each of your stores, but the consent is the same for all your stores. If you accept cookies for one of your stores, the module will consider that you have accepted cookies for all your stores (indicate this in the Cookies Policy) and the warning banner will not appear later in the other stores.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.5.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[84.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1478625-pprod/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2021.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1478625-pbig/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2021.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8741]]></id><name><![CDATA[dmulistecommandes]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[DMU Improved Order List]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Order Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Save time on the processing of your orders!

The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs.

The advanced exclusion rules system gives you the freedom to create an optimized feed by excluding certain products from your ads. The advanced assignment of custom labels to your products further increases the customization of your data feed and allows you to increase the segmentation possibilities of your catalog. Product feeds generated and imported in the Facebook Business Manager will allow you: to automatically supply and keep updated the shop section of your Facebook pageto diffuse product ads on Facebook and Instagram for very targeted audiencesto identify your products in your Facebook and Instagram publications or stories  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY Thanks to countless personal information collected on its network, each more accurate than the others, Facebook has a powerful advertising targeting tool on which Google can not compete. On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users. By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to further enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...). It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations.

Discover Advanced Subscription with automatic recurring payments included]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The "Advanced Subscription" module allows you to make it possible to subscribe to some or all of your products and then ensure a regular revenue. You will also be able to give your customers the possibility to pre-pay their subscription for a certain period, in exchange, for example, for a discount. This module automatically installs for you, all the necessary mechanics to manage your subscriptions. Its extremely flexible operation allows you to define your own rules thanks to a series of relevant options. As for your customers, they enjoy a space allowing them to freely manage their subscriptions, directly through their account. OPT FOR THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE MOMENT! Subscriptions are becoming an increasingly important part of our consumption habits. Peace of mind, saving time and money, the advantages are numerous and in 2019, 85% of European consumers took out at least 1 subscription. As a merchant, offering a subscription to your products ensures you recurring revenues and allows you to anticipate needs, reduce losses and therefore have a better cost management. In addition, because of the automatic renewal of orders, the subscription facilitates the loyalty of your customers. RELY ON A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE MODULE Thanks to "Advanced Subscription" you can easily integrate the subscription into your business model. Once the module is installed, a multitude of options help you create your own rules for managing recurring orders. Among other things, you can give your customers more or less freedom, for example by allowing them to choose their renewal date or by imposing it according to your logistical constraints. Subscription sales are managed independently for each of the products in your catalog, so you can offer the subscription for some products and not others, or even sell a product on subscription only. OFFER PRE-PAYMENT AND SIMPLIFY YOUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT The module gives you the possibility to activate the pre-payment of subscriptions. This allows you to ensure the payment of orders for a certain period of time and to have a better control of the stock of products. In order to encourage your customers to pay in advance, you will be able to offer them different types of discounts! NO NEED TO INSTALL PAYMENT MODULES, "ADVANCED SUBSCRIPTION" INTEGRATES THEM FOR YOU The module comes with a list of payment modules already integrated, including the Stripe and PayPlug modules allowing the automatic renewal of payments (minimum "Pro" offer required for PayPlug). You will just have to enter your merchant account IDs (see information and pricing on https://stripe.com/fr/ and https://www.payplug.com/fr/) and the payment methods will be automatically installed on your site.

The PrestaShop Aliexpress Dropshipping module basically offers merchants the to import products and their combinations from AliExpress into his/her PrestaShop store. After that, they can start selling those products to the customers of the store. As there is no obligation to hold inventory so there is no limit to the number of products they can import from AliExpress. Once the merchant receives an order on the PrestaShop, the automatic ordering process helps them to place the order on Aliexpress with a single click. In order to import the product from AliExpress to PrestaShop, a chrome extension is needed. Follow the link to download the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prestashop-aliexpress-imp/iochebggflimfedlldfjjomnkpoikknk?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog Update Products As you have imported products from AliExpress, it might happen that some product details get updated on AliExpress afterwards. This may arise issues as your customers would treat it as a discrepancy. And, if there is a difference in price then your customer might decide to not buy from your store. So, use the automatic cron settings of the module to automatically apply all the updates on your PrestaShop store too at a set interval.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.4.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[84.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1480730-pprod/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1480730-pbig/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[32277]]></id><name><![CDATA[prestatilldrive]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Drive and Click & Collect / Pick up in-store]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Collection Points & In-Store Pick Up]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The Drive - Click & Collect module for Prestashop allows you to manage and optimize your delivery schedule according to your different stores, opening days & hours, on a simple and optimized interface]]></description><author><![CDATA[ADAM & DEV]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/collection-points-in-store-pick-up/32277-drive-and-click-collect-pick-up-in-store.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/32277.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The Drive - Click & Collect module for Prestashop allows you to manage and optimize your delivery schedule according to your different stores, opening days & hours, on a simple and optimized interface built for smartphones]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The Drive-Click & Collect module for Prestashop allows e-merchants with one or more physical stores to take full advantage of the "Click & Collect".
